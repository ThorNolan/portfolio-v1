<div className="testimonial">
  <p><span>"Fast, affordable, and true to our specifications. Thor took our very old office site and dragged it into the 21st Century adding analytics,
  making it mobile-friendly, polishing the look and feel, but keeping it simple, as requested.
  It was like a window-washing in an old house you just can't leave. On another site, Thor supplied us with spot-on guidance to build a site aimed at eliciting public response for a study project. 
  We love his fast, efficient, time on task service."</span> â€” Brancart & Brancart, client</p>
