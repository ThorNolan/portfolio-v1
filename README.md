ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the repository for all the code for my personal portfolio website. On the site you can easily find any and all information you may be looking for about me and my technical skill-set, as well as links to selected projects, my resume, and a number of means of getting in touch with me. The site is an ongoing labor of love, and I update it quite frequently, so check back for new designs as well as new projects that have been added!

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

+ [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/ReactJS/) with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/).

+ **HTML5** and **SCSS** (utilizing many CSS3 features) for page content and styling.

+ A whole lot of [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/).
      
+ [Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) library to create the animated particle background, I customized the look and animation of the particles by adjusting JSON data that can be found in my main JS file and recently translated this into a functional React component!

+ [Parallax.js](https://matthew.wagerfield.com/parallax/) used for my eclipse scene to accomplish the gyroscopic effect based on either device orientation on a tablet or phone or cursor position on a desktop.
  
+ [Font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com) and [Material Icons](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) for icons.
