            <p id="intro">I'm Thor, a web developer and designer based in
              the Bay Area, CA. I focus on front end development, and appreciate any opportunity to hone my craft and bring my creativity to interesting projects.
              I like collaborating with people to come up with ideal strategies and solutions.</p>
            <br />
            <p>When I'm not coding, I like to climb at my local climbing gym, and I love to travel whenever I can. I'm interested in technology, politics, philosophy, teaching, 
              and everything about this beautiful planet we live on. I also built my desktop PC that I use for playing games, designing things in Illustrator, and working with 3D rendering software like the Unity engine.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I'm sometimes available for freelance work, so if you have a project you'd
              like to work together on <a href="mailto:tnolan5764@gmail.com" id="email" name="tnolan5764@gmail.com">send me an email</a> and we can chat about it.</p>
